# Train-Scheduler
This is the University of Washington Coding Bootcamp<br>
assignment #7. This is an app that utilizes HTML, CSS, <br>
javascript, firebase and moment.js.<br>
The app lets the user input a new train that includes<br>
the train's name, destination, time the first train left, <br>
and frequency of the train. That information is stored<br>
in firebase and is linked to the HTML document showing the<br>
entire history of train entires. The moment.js links to app<br>
by calculating the time information and displaying when the next<br>
train will arrive.<br>
